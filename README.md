# Cloudit

This is a **Next.js** project that I built using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for a web-based file management system. I implemented several features to make file and folder management seamless and intuitive.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.

One can edit the page by modifying `app/page.js`, and the page will auto-update as you save changes.

The project also integrates with [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for Google Font optimization, ensuring better performance.

## Features

Here are some of the standout features I implemented:

* Users can create folders, subfolders, and upload files directly to those folders.
* Users can search for specific files or folders.
* Complete folder deletion, including subfolders and all files within them.
* File size tracking: users can view file types and sizes.
* User authentication via NextAuth.
* Click on a file to view and download it.
